# application setup block
app_setup_block_enabled: true

  **The Default USERNAME and PASSWORD is: abc/abc**

  **Unlike our other containers these Desktops are not designed to be upgraded by Docker, you will keep your home directory but anything you installed system level will be lost if you upgrade an existing container. To keep packages up to date instead use Ubuntu's own apt, Alpine's apk, Fedora's dnf, or Arch's pacman program**

  You will need a Remote Desktop client to access this container [Wikipedia List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_remote_desktop_software), by default it listens on 3389, but you can change that port to whatever you wish on the host side IE `3390:3389`.
  The first thing you should do when you login to the container is to change the abc users password by issuing the `passwd` command.

  **Modern GUI desktop apps (including some flavors terminals) have issues with the latest Docker and syscall compatibility, you can use Docker with the `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined` setting to allow these syscalls or try [podman](https://podman.io/) as they have updated their codebase to support them**

  If you ever lose your password you can always reset it by execing into the container as root:

  ```bash
  docker exec -it rdesktop passwd abc
  ```

  By default we perform all logic for the abc user and we recommend using that user only in the container, but new users can be added as long as there is a `startwm.sh` executable script in their home directory.
  All of these containers are configured with passwordless sudo, we make no efforts to secure or harden these containers and we do not recommend ever publishing their ports to the public Internet.

  ## Options

  All application settings are passed via environment variables:

  | Variable | Description |
  | :----: | --- |
  | LC_ALL | Set the Language for the container to run as IE `fr_FR.UTF-8` `ar_AE.UTF-8` |
  | NO_DECOR | If set the application will run without window borders. (Decor can be enabled and disabled with Ctrl+Shift+d) |
  | NO_FULL | Do not autmatically fullscreen applications when using openbox. |

  ### Language Support - Internationalization

  The environment variable `LC_ALL` can be used to start this image in a different language than English simply pass for example to launch the Desktop session in French `LC_ALL=fr_FR.UTF-8`. Some languages like Chinese, Japanese, or Korean will be missing fonts needed to render properly known as cjk fonts, but others may exist and not be installed. We only ensure fonts for Latin characters are present. Fonts can be installed with a mod on startup.

  To install cjk fonts on startup as an example pass the environment variables(Debian):

  ```
  -e DOCKER_MODS=linuxserver/mods:universal-package-install
  -e INSTALL_PACKAGES=fonts-noto-cjk
  -e LC_ALL=zh_CN.UTF-8
  ```

  ## PRoot Apps

  All images include [proot-apps](https://github.com/linuxserver/proot-apps) which allow portable applications to be installed to persistent storage in the user's `$HOME` directory. These applications and their settings will persist upgrades of the base container and can be mounted into different flavors of rdesktop containers. IE if you are running an Alpine based container you will be able to use the same `/config` directory mounted into an Ubuntu based container and retain the same applications and settings as long as they were installed with `proot-apps install`.

  A list of linuxserver.io supported applications is located [HERE](https://github.com/linuxserver/proot-apps?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-apps).

  ## Open Source GPU Acceleration

  For accelerated apps or games, render devices can be mounted into the container and leveraged by applications using:

  `--device /dev/dri:/dev/dri`

  This feature only supports **Open Source** GPU drivers:

  | Driver | Description |
  | :----: | --- |
  | Intel | i965 and i915 drivers for Intel iGPU chipsets |
  | AMD | AMDGPU, Radeon, and ATI drivers for AMD dedicated or APU chipsets |
  | NVIDIA | nouveau2 drivers only, closed source NVIDIA drivers lack DRI3 support |

  ## Nvidia GPU Support

  **Nvidia is not compatible with Alpine based images**

  Nvidia support is available by leveraging Zink for OpenGL support. This can be enabled with the following run flags:

  | Variable | Description |
  | :----: | --- |
  | --gpus all | This can be filtered down but for most setups this will pass the one Nvidia GPU on the system |
  | --runtime nvidia | Specify the Nvidia runtime which mounts drivers and tools in from the host |

  The compose syntax is slightly different for this as you will need to set nvidia as the default runtime:

  ```
  sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker --set-as-default
  sudo service docker restart
  ```

  And to assign the GPU in compose:

  ```
  services:
    myimage:
      image: myname/myimage:mytag
      deploy:
        resources:
          reservations:
            devices:
              - driver: nvidia
                count: 1
                capabilities: [compute,video,graphics,utility]
  ```
